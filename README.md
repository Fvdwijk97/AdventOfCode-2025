# Advent of Code - Learning & Practice
This repository contains my solutions for various Advent of Code challenges. I use these puzzles to practice 
problem‑solving, strengthen my Python skills, and apply concepts I’m learning during my data engineering bootcamp. 
Each solution includes a short explanation of my approach to make the reasoning behind the code clear and easy to follow.
